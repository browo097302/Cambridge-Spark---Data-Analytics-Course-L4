# Cambridge-Spark---Data-Analytics-Course-L4
A collection of the Data projects I completed as part of the 3 month government funded scheme with Cambridge Spark - Data Analytics L4.

#### Python
#### Pandas + SQL
#### Data Visualisations in Python
#### Hackathon
#### Treadmills Project

Note: This Repository contains materials provided by course provider Cambridge Spark. The Hackathon and Treadmills Project were group tasks, the Treadmills Notebook shows my code and contributions to the project while the Hackathon Notebook is all group member's work combined.
